Consumers should stop using recalled products immediately unless otherwise instructed. It is illegal to resell or attempt to resell a recalled consumer product. Name of Product: Beeswax Rope Candle (SKU # 34-911) Units: About 2,000 Manufacturer: Zhongshan Zhongnam Candle Manufacturer Co., Ltd. of China Hazard: The candle has a clamp (vise) that leads the end of the rope candle at the top. When clamped properly it is supposed to self-extinguish the candle when the burning wick meets the metal clamp (vise). The clamp (vise) does not always sever the wax close to the wick and does not always enable the wick to self-extinguish. This can lead to the flame continuing down into the coiled section of the candle, which can then ignite and cause fire damage. Incidents/Injuries: Three incidents were reported where the candle continued to burn past the point where it is supposed to self-extinguish. There was some property damage in two incidents; however, nobody was hurt. Description: The Rope Candle is a 21-foot coiled beeswax candle that feeds up to a scissors-like vise. The candle is lit above the vise. The candle is 7-inches tall and sits on an antiqued copper-finish holder. Sold at: Gardener's Supply retail store in Burlington, Vt., and in the Holiday 2004 Gardener's Supply Catalog sold the candles from October 20 through November 12, 2004. Manufactured In: China. Remedy: The firm has designed a scissor like attachment that fits on top of the clamp (vise). This cuts the wax from the sides and extinguishes the flame, preventing the candle from burning below the attachment and igniting the entire candle. The firm will either replace the candle with the new fitting, give store credit for the original cost of the rope candle or give a full refund.

(Dec. 10) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today warned consumers and religious groups that they may be subjecting themselves needlessly to airborne lead through use of candles containing lead-core wicks. The amount of lead vapor given off by such candles is small and does not, by itself, present an unreasonable health hazard, but the additional lead may present a problem for persons exposed to other sources of lead poisoning, such as older housing with lead-based paint, or in urban neighborhoods with high concentrations of automobile exhaust. The hazards of lead-poisoning are well documented, particularly in infants and young children where brain damage may result. In December 1973, the Health Research Group, a Washington, D.C.,-based public interest group, submitted a petition but at that time, the Commission found that the risk of illness was not sufficient to declare lead-wick candles an imminent hazard and ban them as the petition requested. In view of the known harmful effects of lead ingestion and the growing concern over amounts of lead in the environment from a variety of sources, the continued use of lead-core wicks in candles may be unwise. After the petition, the majority of the industry responded with a commitment to discontinue the use of lead-core wick as soon as a satisfactory substitute could be found and within the year, lead-wick candles were virtually off the market and the sole known producer of lead-core wicking discontinued its production and distribution. The Commission commends this action by the industry. However, it has recently come to the Commission's attention that three firms are producing lead-core wicking and that it is being purchased for use in candles. One firm has decided to cease production and sale of the wicking. Two other firms are continuing to produce lead-core wicking. The remaining two are the Queens Braidworks, Inc., Middle Village, Queens, New York; and the American Wick Company, North Bergen, New Jersey. The primary use for this new wicking appears to be in glass container candles and votive lights used by churches. Votive lights are in some cases burned perpetually and in large numbers. Since candles with lead wicks may continue to be available to consumers, the Commission is considering various options, including a labeling requirement so that all such candles can be identified as containing lead wicks. In the meantime, consumers can easily identify candles with lead-core wicking by a close examination of the candle wick. The lead wire running through the center can be exposed by peeling back the surrounding cotton braid. In view of the ready availability of adequate substitutes for lead wicks in candles, the Commission wishes to remind consumers and candle manufacturers of the needless, potentially harmful effects associated with their continued use.\", 'URL': 'https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1976/CPSC-Warns-Of-Potential-Risk-Associated-With-Certain-Candles-With-Lead-Core-Wicks', 'Title': 'Candles With Lead-Core Wicks Warn', 'ConsumerContact': None, 'LastPublishDate': '2015-02-04T00:00:00', 'Products': [{'Name': 'American Wick Company candles with lead-core candle wicks', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': 'Candles & Candle Holders', 'CategoryID': '1872', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': 'Queens Braidworks candles with lead-core candle wicks', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': '', 'CategoryID': '', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}], 'Inconjunctions': [], 'Images': [], 'Injuries': [], 'Manufacturers': [{'Name': 'American Wick', 'CompanyID': ''}, {'Name': 'Queens Braidworks', 'CompanyID': ''}], 'Retailers': [], 'Importers': [], 'Distributors': [], 'SoldAtLabel': None, 'ManufacturerCountries': [], 'ProductUPCs': [], 'Hazards': [{'Name': 'Lead', 'HazardType': '', 'HazardTypeID': ''}], 'Remedies': [], 'RemedyOptions': []}]\n"

Although relatively static, completing this step serves a pedogogical and psychological purpose: It pivots the students to thinking about how to communicate results to an audience, and how the project could become an ongoing endeavor rather than a single analytical exercise.\n",

        "\n",
        "- CDC WONDER API for Data Query Web Service: Includes death certificates with causes since approximately the 1990's.\n",
        "- Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS): Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains an API that provides Census data on housing problems and needs unavailable through other sources, including IPUMS.\n",
        "- Federal Election Commission API: Provides historical and up to the minute campaign finance data.\n",
        "- Toxic Release Inventory: Provided by the Environmental Protection Agency, this API documents the release and management of over 800 toxic substances, reported annually by privately owned facilities and the government.\n",
        "- Petroleum Data, Prices: Provides prices of petroleum products and crude oil at weekly, monthly, and yearly time scales.\n",
        "- Fair Market Rents Lookup tool: Fair Market Rents (FMRs) determine the value of housing vouchers for Section 8 renters. This API provides the FMR values and other measures of housing affordability.\n",
        "- Annual Economic Surveys, Business Patterns: Surveys of businesses at the zip code level, tracking economic sentiment and activity.\n",
        "- Food Access Research Atlas: Provides spatial data on food access and the availability of supermarkets within census tracts. Can be merged with census data to look at under-served populations and food deserts.\n",
        "- National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration: Provides API access to data on real time weather and climate change projections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of these API resources could either be the cornerstone of a project or a source of additional data. These data sources have a number of advantages: They're free, most of them can be accessed using the same API key, and most have similar documentation for how to write a query. This is ideal for students to iterate, experiment, and take risks, with little cost to failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to government data, many commerical apps provide API access to developers and researchers. AirBnB, Amazon, Reddit, eBay, X, and many others maintain API access to develop third-party apps. These opportunities present many advantages: The data are larger, have more variety, and there are vastly many more cases. Building a third-party app that includes analytics could easily consume an entire semester and open a variety of applications in predictive analytics, natural language processing, and generative AI (e.g. predict which reviews are fake or real for Amazon for a product group like ``women's watches', and then make recommendations for different price points). While an exciting possibility, this can also raise a lot of problems: Some API's cost money or are rate-limited depending on a subscription, and others impose significant constraints on how the data can be used. In some cases, a more useful approach might be explicit web scraping using a package like BeautifulSoup or Selenium. For example, Craigslist has no API, but can easily and productively be scraped using BeautifulSoup.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Pick an API, download some data, wrangle them, and produce some EDA results, as we did in the previous steps with the saferproducts.gov API; or, if you can't get it to work, document why. If you have the time and it's low cost, push the results to a streamlit page. If you have had enough, I recommend https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/electricity, since there is a friendly query builder that you can use to learn.**"
